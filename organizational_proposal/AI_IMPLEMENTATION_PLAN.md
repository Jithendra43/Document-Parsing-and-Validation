    raise ValidationError("Missing required elements")

# AI-Enhanced: Predictive validation
confidence, prediction = ai_validator.predict_success(
    transaction=parsed_edi,
    payer=payer_id,
    provider_history=provider_patterns
)
if confidence < 0.85:
    suggest_improvements(prediction.recommendations)
```
