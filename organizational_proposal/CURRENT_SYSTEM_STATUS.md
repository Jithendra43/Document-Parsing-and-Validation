## ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. pyx12 Library Compatibility Warnings
**Issue**: Some pyx12 method calls generating warnings  
**Impact**: Low - System falls back to manual parsing successfully  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Working but needs optimization  

**Log Evidence**:
```
{"event": "Error reading segment at position 0: 'X12Reader' object has no attribute 'next'", "logger": "app.core.edi_parser", "level": "warning"}
```

**Solution**: Update pyx12 integration method for better compatibility

### 2. FHIR Mapping Edge Cases
**Issue**: Some FHIR field requirements need adjustment  
**Impact**: Low - System processes successfully, minor validation warnings  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Working but needs refinement  

**Recent Fixes Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Added missing `kind="insurance"` field to Coverage resource
- ‚úÖ Changed `coverage.payor` to `coverage.insurer` for FHIR R4 compliance  
- ‚úÖ Fixed date format for CoverageEligibilityRequest

### 3. Export Format Handling
**Issue**: Some export formats showing "unsupported" in logs  
**Impact**: Low - Validation export working, others need enhancement  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial functionality  

**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ Validation export: Working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è JSON/XML/EDI export: Needs format mapping enhancement
